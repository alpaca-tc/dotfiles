Module managing the underlying network protocol(s) used by drb.

By default, drb uses the [[c:DRbTCPSocket protocol]]. Other protocols can be defined. 

A new protocol is registered with the DRbProtocol module using the add_protocol method.

For examples of other protocols, see [[c:DRb::DRbUNIXSocket]] in [[lib:drb/unix]], and HTTP0 in sample/http0.rb and sample/http0serv.rb in the full drb distribution.

All of these methods should raise a [[c:DRb::DRbBadScheme]] error if
the URI does not identify the protocol they support (e.g. "druby:" for
the standard Ruby protocol). This is how the [[c:DRb::DRbProtocol]] module, given
a URI, determines which protocol implementation serves that protocol.
