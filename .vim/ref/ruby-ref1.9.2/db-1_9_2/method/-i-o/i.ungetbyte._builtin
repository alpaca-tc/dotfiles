--- ungetbyte(c) -> nil

Pushes back bytes (passed as a parameter) onto <em>ios</em>,
such that a subsequent buffered read will return it. Only one byte
may be pushed back before a subsequent read operation (that is,
you will be able to read only the last of several bytes that have been pushed
back). Has no effect with unbuffered reads (such as <code>IO#sysread</code>).

@param c 

Îã:

   f = File.new("testfile")   #=> #<File:testfile>
   b = f.getbyte              #=> 0x38
   f.ungetbyte(b)             #=> nil
   f.getbyte                  #=> 0x38
