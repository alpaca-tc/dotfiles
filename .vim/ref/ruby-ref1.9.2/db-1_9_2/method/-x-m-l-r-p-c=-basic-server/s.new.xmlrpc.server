--- new( class_delim="." )

Creates a new XMLRPC::BasicServer instance, which should not be
done, because XMLRPC::BasicServer is an abstract class. This
method should be called from a subclass indirectly by a super call
in the method initialize. The paramter class_delim is used
in [[mXMLRPC::BasicServer#add_handler]] when an object is
added as handler, to delimit the object-prefix and the method-name.
