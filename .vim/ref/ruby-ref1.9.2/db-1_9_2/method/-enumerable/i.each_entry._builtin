--- each_entry -> Enumerator
--- each_entry {|obj| block} -> self

Calls <i>block</i> once for each element in <i>self</i>, passing that
element as a parameter, converting multiple values from yield to an
array.

   class Foo
     include Enumerable
     def each
       yield 1
       yield 1,2
     end
   end
   Foo.new.each_entry{|o| print o, " -- "}

produces:

   1 -- [1, 2] --
