--- check_insecure_method(obj, msg_id)

Check that a method is callable via dRuby.
obj is the object we want to invoke the method on. msg_id is the method name, as a Symbol.
If the method is an insecure method (see insecure_method?) a SecurityError is thrown. If the method is private or undefined, a [[c:NameError]] is thrown.
