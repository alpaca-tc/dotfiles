--- new(uri=nil, front=nil, config_or_acl=nil)

Create a new DRbServer instance.

uri is the URI to bind to. This is normally of the form 
¡Ædruby://<hostname>:<port>¡Ç where <hostname> is a hostname of the
local machine. If nil, then the system¡Çs default hostname will be
bound to, on a port selected by the system; these value can be
retrieved from the uri attribute. ¡Ædruby:¡Ç specifies the default
dRuby transport protocol: another protocol, such as ¡Ædrbunix:¡Ç, can
be specified instead.

front is the front object for the server, that is, the object to which
remote method calls on the server will be passed. If nil, then the
server will not accept remote method calls.

If config_or_acl is a hash, it is the configuration to use for this server. 
The following options are recognised:

: idconv

an id-to-object conversion object. This defaults to an instance of the class DRb::DRbIdConv.

: verbose
if true, all unsuccessful remote calls on objects in the server will be logged to $stdout. false by default.

: tcp_acl
the access control list for this server. See the ACL class from the main dRuby distribution.

: load_limit
the maximum message size in bytes accepted by the server. Defaults to 25 MB (26214400).

: argc_limit
the maximum number of arguments to a remote method accepted by the server. Defaults to 256.

The default values of these options can be modified on a class-wide
basis by the class methods default_argc_limit, default_load_limit,
default_acl, default_id_conv, and verbose=

If config_or_acl is not a hash, but is not nil, it is assumed to be
the access control list for this server. See the :tcp_acl option for
more details.

If no other server is currently set as the primary server, this will
become the primary server.

The server will immediately start running in its own thread.
