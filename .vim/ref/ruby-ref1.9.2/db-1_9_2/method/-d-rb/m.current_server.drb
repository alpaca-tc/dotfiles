--- current_server

Get the 'current' server.

In the context of execution taking place within the main thread
of a dRuby server (typically, as a result of a remote call on
the server or one of its objects), the current server is that
server. Otherwise, the current server is the primary server.

If the above rule fails to find a server, a DRbServerNotFound
error is raised.
