--- init_pair(pair, f, b) -> bool

Changes the definition of a color-pair.

It takes three arguments: the number of the color-pair to be changed +pair+,
the foreground color number +f+, and the background color number +b+.

If the color-pair was previously initialized, the screen is
refreshed and all occurrences of that color-pair are changed
to the new definition.
