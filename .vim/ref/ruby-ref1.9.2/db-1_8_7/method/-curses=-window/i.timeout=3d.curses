--- timeout=(delay)
Sets block and non-blocking reads for the window.
 * If delay is negative, blocking read is used (i.e., waits indefinitely for input).
 * If delay is zero, then non-blocking read is used (i.e., read returns ERR if no input is waiting).
 * If delay is positive, then read blocks for delay milliseconds, and returns ERR if there is still no input.
