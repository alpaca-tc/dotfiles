--- proxy( prefix, *args )

Returns an object of class XMLRPC::Client::Proxy, initialized with
prefix and args. A proxy object returned by this method behaves
like [[unknown:XMLRPC::Client#call]], i.e. a call on that object will raise a
XMLRPC::FaultException when a fault-structure is returned by that call.
