Is the base class for all XML-RPC server-types (CGI, standalone).
You can add handler and set a default handler.
Do not use this server, as this is/should be an abstract class.

=== How the method to call is found

The arity (number of accepted arguments) of a handler (method or Proc object) is
compared to the given arguments submitted by the client for a RPC ((-Remote Procedure Call-)).
A handler is only called if it accepts the number of arguments, otherwise the search
for another handler will go on. When at the end no handler was found,
the [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer#set_default_handler]] will be called.
With this technique it is possible to do overloading by number of parameters, but
only for Proc handler, because you cannot define two methods of the same name in
the same class.
