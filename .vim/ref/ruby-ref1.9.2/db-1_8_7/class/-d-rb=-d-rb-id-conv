Class responsible for converting between an object and its id.

This, the default implementation, uses an object's local ObjectSpace
id as its id. This means that an object's identification over drb
remains valid only while that object instance remains alive within the
server runtime.

For alternative mechanisms,
see [[c:DRb::TimerIdConv]] in [[lib:drb/timeridconv]]
and DRbNameIdConv in sample/name.rb in the full drb distribution.
