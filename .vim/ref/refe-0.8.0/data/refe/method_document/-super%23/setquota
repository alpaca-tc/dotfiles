: setquota(mailbox, quota)
      Sends a SETQUOTA command along with the specified mailbox and
      quota.  If quota is nil, then quota will be unset for that
      mailbox.  Typically one needs to be logged in as server admin
      for this to work.  The IMAP quota commands are described in
      imap.rb"/[RFC-2087].
