: setacl(mailbox, user, rights)
      Sends the SETACL command along with mailbox, user and the
      rights that user is to have on that mailbox.  If rights is nil,
      then that user will be stripped of any rights to that mailbox.
      The IMAP ACL commands are described in imap.rb"/[RFC-2086].
