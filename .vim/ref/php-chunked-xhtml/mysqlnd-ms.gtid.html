   <strong>Version requirement</strong><br />
   <p class="para">
    Client side global transaction ID injection exists as of mysqlnd_ms version 1.2.0-alpha.
    Transaction boundaries are detected by monitoring API calls. This is possible
    as of PHP 5.4.0. Please, see also <a href="mysqlnd-ms.transaction.html" class="link">Transaction handling</a>.
   </p>
  </p></blockquote>
  <p class="para">
   PECL/mysqlnd_ms can do client-side transparent global transaction ID injection.
   In its most basic form, a global transaction identifier is a counter which is
   incremented for every transaction executed on the master. The counter is held
   in a table on the master. Slaves replicate the counter table.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   In case of a master failure a database administrator can easily identify the
   most recent slave for promiting it as a new master. The most recent slave has
   the highest transaction identifier.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Application developers can ask the plugin for the global transaction identifier
   (GTID) for their last successful write operation. The plugin will return
   an identifier that refers to an transaction no older than that of the clients last
   write operation. Then, the GTID can be passed as a parameter
   to the quality of service (QoS) filter as an option for session consistency.
   Session consistency ensures read your writes. The filter ensures that all
   reads are either directed to a master or a slave which has replicated the write
   referenced by the GTID.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">When injection is done</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The plugin transparently maintains the GTID table on the master.
   In autocommit mode the plugin injects an <em>UPDATE</em> statement
   before executing the users statement for every master use. In manual
   transaction mode, the injection is done before the application calls
   <em>commit()</em> to close a transaction. The configuration option
   <em>report_error</em> of the GTID section in the plugins configuration
   file is used to control whether a failed injection shall abort the current
   operation or be ignored silently (default).
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Please note, the
   PHP version requirements for
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.transaction.html" class="link">transaction boundary monitoring</a>
   and their limits.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Limitations</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Client-side global transaction ID injection has shortcomings. The potential
   issues are not specific to PECL/mysqlnd_ms but are rather of general nature.
   <ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      The GTID can have holes. Only PHP clients using the plugin will
      maintain the table. Other clients will not.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Client-side transaction boundary detection is based on API calls only.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Client-side transaction boundary detection does not take implicit
      commit into account. Some MySQL SQL statements cause an implicit
      commit and cannot be rolled back.

   </ul>
  </p>
  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">注意</strong>: 
   <strong>Server-side global transaction ID support</strong><br />
   <p class="para">
    The plugin is prepared to support MySQL servers which implement global
    transaction ID support and which maintain a global transaction ID themselves.
    Client-side injection would not be necessary with such servers. However,
    without any server supporting it yet and, in heterogenous environments with
    old MySQL servers, client-side injection is a valuable, although not perfect,
    option.
