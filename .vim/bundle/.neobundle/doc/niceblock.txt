INTRODUCTION					*niceblock-introduction*

*niceblock* is a Vim plugin to make blockwise Visual mode, especially
Visual-block Inserting/Appending, more useful.  Suppose that you want to
comment out a code snippet.  There are various ways to do so.  One is to do
the following steps:

(1) Start Visual mode with |v|;
(2) Select a code block by |ip|;
(3) Make Visual mode blockwise by |v_CTRL-V|;
(4) Insert a comment character for each selected line by |v_b_I|;

It's a useful combination to edit text, but there are a few problems:

(a) We have to |v_CTRL-V| to make Visual mode blockwise,
    because |v_b_I| and |v_b_A| are available only in blockwise Visual mode.
    It is not intuitive; why are not they available in all kinds of Visual
    mode?
(b) Selected area often becomes unsuitable to immediately |v_b_I| and |v_b_A|
    after switching to blockwise Visual mode from linewise one.
    Because column positions don't matter in linewise Visual mode,
    while they matter in blockwise Visual mode.  So that we often have to
    adjust cursor positions after |v_CTRL-V|.  It would be better to automate
    such adjustments, wouldn't it?

This plugin changes the behavior of I and A in Visual mode to:

* Make |v_b_I| and |v_b_A| available in all kinds of Visual mode.
* Adjust the selected area to be intuitive before doing blockwise insertion
  from linewise Visual mode.

Both just save a few key types.  For example, you can type:

* "vipI# <Esc>" instead of "vip<C-v>0I# <Esc>".
* "vipA++<Esc>" instead of "vip<C-v>$A++<Esc>".

But the effect is significant.  It makes blockwise Visual mode more useful and
intuitive.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.3 or later

INTERFACE					*niceblock-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*niceblock-key-mappings*

DEFAULT KEY MAPPINGS				*niceblock-default-key-mappings*

Modes	{lhs}		{rhs}
------------------------------------------------
v	I		|<Plug>(niceblock-I)|
v	A		|<Plug>(niceblock-A)|


NAMED KEY MAPPINGS				*niceblock-named-key-mappings*

<Plug>(niceblock-I)				*<Plug>(niceblock-I)*
			Like |v_b_I|, but:
			
			* It's available in all kinds of Visual mode.
			* It adjusts the selected area to get intuitive result
			  after blockwise insertion if the current mode is not
			  blockwise.

<Plug>(niceblock-A)				*<Plug>(niceblock-A)*
			Like |<Plug>(niceblock-I)|, but it's corresponding to
			|v_b_A| instead of |v_b_I|.
