.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves\&.
.sp
By default, notes are saved to and read from refs/notes/commits, but this default can be overridden\&. See the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and ENVIRONMENT sections below\&. If this ref does not exist, it will be quietly created when it is first needed to store a note\&.
.sp
A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without changing the commit itself\&. Notes can be shown by \fIgit log\fR along with the original commit message\&. To distinguish these notes from the message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented line saying "Notes (<refname>):" (or "Notes:" for refs/notes/commits)\&.
.sp
To change which notes are shown by \fIgit log\fR, see the "notes\&.displayRef" configuration in \fBgit-log\fR(1)\&.
.sp
See the "notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>" configuration for a way to carry notes across commands that rewrite commits\&.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.PP
list
.RS 4
List the notes object for a given object\&. If no object is given, show a list of all note objects and the objects they annotate (in the format "<note object> <annotated object>")\&. This is the default subcommand if no subcommand is given\&.
.RE
.PP
add
.RS 4
Add notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&. Abort if the object already has notes (use
\-f
to overwrite existing notes)\&. However, if you\(cqre using
add
interactively (using an editor to supply the notes contents), then \- instead of aborting \- the existing notes will be opened in the editor (like the
edit
subcommand)\&.
.RE
.PP
copy
.RS 4
Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object\&. Abort if the second object already has notes, or if the first object has none (use \-f to overwrite existing notes to the second object)\&. This subcommand is equivalent to:
git notes add [\-f] \-C $(git notes list <from\-object>) <to\-object>
.sp
In
\-\-stdin
mode, take lines in the format
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<from\-object> SP <to\-object> [ SP <rest> ] LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
on standard input, and copy the notes from each <from\-object> to its corresponding <to\-object>\&. (The optional
<rest>
is ignored so that the command can read the input given to the
post\-rewrite
hook\&.)
.RE
.PP
append
.RS 4
Append to the notes of an existing object (defaults to HEAD)\&. Creates a new notes object if needed\&.
.RE
.PP
edit
.RS 4
Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&.
.RE
.PP
show
.RS 4
Show the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&.
.RE
.PP
merge
.RS 4
Merge the given notes ref into the current notes ref\&. This will try to merge the changes made by the given notes ref (called "remote") since the merge\-base (if any) into the current notes ref (called "local")\&.
.sp
If conflicts arise and a strategy for automatically resolving conflicting notes (see the \-s/\-\-strategy option) is not given, the "manual" resolver is used\&. This resolver checks out the conflicting notes in a special worktree (\&.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE), and instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts there\&. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with
\fIgit notes merge \-\-commit\fR, or abort the merge with
\fIgit notes merge \-\-abort\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
remove
.RS 4
Remove the notes for given objects (defaults to HEAD)\&. When giving zero or one object from the command line, this is equivalent to specifying an empty note message to the
edit
subcommand\&.
.RE
.PP
prune
.RS 4
Remove all notes for non\-existing/unreachable objects\&.
.RE
.PP
get\-ref
.RS 4
Print the current notes ref\&. This provides an easy way to retrieve the current notes ref (e\&.g\&. from scripts)\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
When adding notes to an object that already has notes, overwrite the existing notes (instead of aborting)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m <msg>, \-\-message=<msg>
.RS 4
Use the given note message (instead of prompting)\&. If multiple
\-m
options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs\&. Lines starting with
#
and empty lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be stripped out\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F <file>, \-\-file=<file>
.RS 4
Take the note message from the given file\&. Use
\fI\-\fR
to read the note message from the standard input\&. Lines starting with
#
and empty lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be stripped out\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C <object>, \-\-reuse\-message=<object>
.RS 4
Take the given blob object (for example, another note) as the note message\&. (Use
git notes copy <object>
instead to copy notes between objects\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-c <object>, \-\-reedit\-message=<object>
.RS 4
Like
\fI\-C\fR, but with
\fI\-c\fR
the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the note message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ref <ref>
.RS 4
Manipulate the notes tree in <ref>\&. This overrides
\fIGIT_NOTES_REF\fR
and the "core\&.notesRef" configuration\&. The ref is taken to be in
refs/notes/
if it is not qualified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-missing
.RS 4
Do not consider it an error to request removing notes from an object that does not have notes attached to it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
Also read the object names to remove notes from from the standard input (there is no reason you cannot combine this with object names from the command line)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Do not remove anything; just report the object names whose notes would be removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s <strategy>, \-\-strategy=<strategy>
.RS 4
When merging notes, resolve notes conflicts using the given strategy\&. The following strategies are recognized: "manual" (default), "ours", "theirs", "union" and "cat_sort_uniq"\&. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section below for more information on each notes merge strategy\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-commit
.RS 4
Finalize an in\-progress
\fIgit notes merge\fR\&. Use this option when you have resolved the conflicts that
\fIgit notes merge\fR
stored in \&.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\&. This amends the partial merge commit created by
\fIgit notes merge\fR
(stored in \&.git/NOTES_MERGE_PARTIAL) by adding the notes in \&.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\&. The notes ref stored in the \&.git/NOTES_MERGE_REF symref is updated to the resulting commit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abort
.RS 4
Abort/reset a in\-progress
\fIgit notes merge\fR, i\&.e\&. a notes merge with conflicts\&. This simply removes all files related to the notes merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
When merging notes, operate quietly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
When merging notes, be more verbose\&. When pruning notes, report all object names whose notes are removed\&.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
Commit notes are blobs containing extra information about an object (usually information to supplement a commit\(cqs message)\&. These blobs are taken from notes refs\&. A notes ref is usually a branch which contains "files" whose paths are the object names for the objects they describe, with some directory separators included for performance reasons \&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Every notes change creates a new commit at the specified notes ref\&. You can therefore inspect the history of the notes by invoking, e\&.g\&., git log \-p notes/commits\&. Currently the commit message only records which operation triggered the update, and the commit authorship is determined according to the usual rules (see \fBgit-commit\fR(1))\&. These details may change in the future\&.
.sp
It is also permitted for a notes ref to point directly to a tree object, in which case the history of the notes can be read with git log \-p \-g <refname>\&.
.SH "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
.sp
The default notes merge strategy is "manual", which checks out conflicting notes in a special work tree for resolving notes conflicts (\&.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE), and instructs the user to resolve the conflicts in that work tree\&. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with \fIgit notes merge \-\-commit\fR, or abort the merge with \fIgit notes merge \-\-abort\fR\&.
.sp
"ours" automatically resolves conflicting notes in favor of the local version (i\&.e\&. the current notes ref)\&.
.sp
"theirs" automatically resolves notes conflicts in favor of the remote version (i\&.e\&. the given notes ref being merged into the current notes ref)\&.
.sp
"union" automatically resolves notes conflicts by concatenating the local and remote versions\&.
.sp
"cat_sort_uniq" is similar to "union", but in addition to concatenating the local and remote versions, this strategy also sorts the resulting lines, and removes duplicate lines from the result\&. This is equivalent to applying the "cat | sort | uniq" shell pipeline to the local and remote versions\&. This strategy is useful if the notes follow a line\-based format where one wants to avoid duplicated lines in the merge result\&. Note that if either the local or remote version contain duplicate lines prior to the merge, these will also be removed by this notes merge strategy\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
You can use notes to add annotations with information that was not available at the time a commit was written\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.sp
.sp
In principle, a note is a regular Git blob, and any kind of (non\-)format is accepted\&. You can binary\-safely create notes from arbitrary files using \fIgit hash\-object\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cc *\&.c
$ blob=$(git hash\-object \-w a\&.out)
$ git notes \-\-ref=built add \-C "$blob" HEAD
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
(You cannot simply use git notes \-\-ref=built add \-F a\&.out HEAD because that is not binary\-safe\&.) Of course, it doesn\(cqt make much sense to display non\-text\-format notes with \fIgit log\fR, so if you use such notes, you\(cqll probably need to write some special\-purpose tools to do something useful with them\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
