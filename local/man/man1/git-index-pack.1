.SH "NAME"
git-index-pack \- Build pack index file for an existing packed archive
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit index\-pack\fR [\-v] [\-o <index\-file>] <pack\-file>
\fIgit index\-pack\fR \-\-stdin [\-\-fix\-thin] [\-\-keep] [\-v] [\-o <index\-file>]
                 [<pack\-file>]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Reads a packed archive (\&.pack) from the specified file, and builds a pack index file (\&.idx) for it\&. The packed archive together with the pack index can then be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git repository\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status\&.
.RE
.PP
\-o <index\-file>
.RS 4
Write the generated pack index into the specified file\&. Without this option the name of pack index file is constructed from the name of packed archive file by replacing \&.pack with \&.idx (and the program fails if the name of packed archive does not end with \&.pack)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin instead and a copy is then written to <pack\-file>\&. If <pack\-file> is not specified, the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the current git repository with a default name determined from the pack content\&. If <pack\-file> is not specified consider using \-\-keep to prevent a race condition between this process and
\fIgit repack\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-fix\-thin
.RS 4
Fix a "thin" pack produced by
git pack\-objects \-\-thin
(see
\fBgit-pack-objects\fR(1)
for details) by adding the excluded objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack\&. This option only makes sense in conjunction with \-\-stdin\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep
.RS 4
Before moving the index into its final destination create an empty \&.keep file for the associated pack file\&. This option is usually necessary with \-\-stdin to prevent a simultaneous
\fIgit repack\fR
process from deleting the newly constructed pack and index before refs can be updated to use objects contained in the pack\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep=<msg>
.RS 4
Like \-\-keep create a \&.keep file before moving the index into its final destination, but rather than creating an empty file place
\fI<msg>\fR
followed by an LF into the \&.keep file\&. The
\fI<msg>\fR
message can later be searched for within all \&.keep files to locate any which have outlived their usefulness\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-index\-version=<version>[,<offset>]
.RS 4
This is intended to be used by the test suite only\&. It allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64\-bit index entries on objects located above the given offset\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-strict
.RS 4
Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
Once the index has been created, the list of object names is sorted and the SHA1 hash of that list is printed to stdout\&. If \-\-stdin was also used then this is prefixed by either "pack\et", or "keep\et" if a new \&.keep file was successfully created\&. This is useful to remove a \&.keep file used as a lock to prevent the race with \fIgit repack\fR mentioned above\&.
