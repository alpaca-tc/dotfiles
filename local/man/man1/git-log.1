.SH "NAME"
git-log \- Show commit logs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit log\fR [<options>] [<since>\&.\&.<until>] [[\-\-] <path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows the commit logs\&.
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the \fIgit rev\-list\fR command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the \fIgit diff\-*\fR commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-<n>
.RS 4
Limits the number of commits to show\&. Note that this is a commit limiting option, see below\&.
.RE
.PP
<since>\&.\&.<until>
.RS 4
Show only commits between the named two commits\&. When either <since> or <until> is omitted, it defaults to
HEAD, i\&.e\&. the tip of the current branch\&. For a more complete list of ways to spell <since> and <until>, see
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-follow
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-decorate, \-\-decorate[=short|full|no]
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\&. If
\fIshort\fR
is specified, the ref name prefixes
\fIrefs/heads/\fR,
\fIrefs/tags/\fR
and
\fIrefs/remotes/\fR
will not be printed\&. If
\fIfull\fR
is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed\&. The default option is
\fIshort\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-source
.RS 4
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-diff
.RS 4
Without this flag, "git log \-p <path>\&..." shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\&. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "<path>\&..." limits only commits, and doesn\(cqt limit diff for those commits\&.
.sp
Note that this affects all diff\-based output types, e\&.g\&. those produced by \-\-stat etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-size
.RS 4
Before the log message print out its size in bytes\&. Intended mainly for porcelain tools consumption\&. If git is unable to produce a valid value size is set to zero\&. Note that only message is considered, if also a diff is shown its size is not included\&.
.RE
.PP
[\-\-] <path>\&...
.RS 4
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&. See "History Simplification" below for details and other simplification modes\&.
.sp
To prevent confusion with options and branch names, paths may need to be prefixed with "\-\- " to separate them from options or refnames\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&. Note that they are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fI\-\-reverse\fR\&.
.PP
\-n \fInumber\fR, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given \-\-grep, \-\-author and \-\-committer instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regexp limiting patterns without regard to letters case\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merges
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-min\-parents=2\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-max\-parents=1\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-min\-parents=<number>, \-\-max\-parents=<number>, \-\-no\-min\-parents, \-\-no\-max\-parents
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many commits\&. In particular,
\-\-max\-parents=1
is the same as
\-\-no\-merges,
\-\-min\-parents=2
is the same as
\-\-merges\&.
\-\-max\-parents=0
gives all root commits and
\-\-min\-parents=3
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\-\-no\-min\-parents
and
\-\-no\-max\-parents
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\-\-min\-parents=0
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\-\-max\-parents=\-1
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-not
.RS 4
Reverses the meaning of the
\fI^\fR
prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
\fI\-\-not\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-branches[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/heads
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-tags[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/tags
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remotes[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/remotes
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit remote\-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. Leading
\fIrefs/\fR, is automatically prepended if missing\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-missing
.RS 4
Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not given\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bisect
.RS 4
Pretend as if the bad bisection ref
refs/bisect/bad
was listed and as if it was followed by
\-\-not
and the good bisection refs
refs/bisect/good\-*
on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
In addition to the
\fI<commit>\fR
listed on the command line, read them from the standard input\&. If a
\fI\-\-\fR
separator is seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the result\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-mark
.RS 4
Like
\-\-cherry\-pick
(see below) but mark equivalent commits with
=
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
+\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the "other side" when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
A
and
B, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\-\-left\-right
(see the example below in the description of the
\-\-left\-right
option)\&. It however shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, "3rd on b" may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-only, \-\-right\-only
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric range, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked
<
resp\&.
>
by
\-\-left\-right\&.
.sp
For example,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only A\&...B
omits those commits from
B
which are in
A
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
A\&. In other words, this lists the
+
commits from
git cherry A B\&. More precisely,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only \-\-no\-merges
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry
.RS 4
A synonym for
\-\-right\-only \-\-cherry\-mark \-\-no\-merges; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
git log \-\-cherry upstream\&...mybranch, similar to
git cherry upstream mybranch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fI^commit\fR,
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR, nor
\fIcommit1\&.\&.\&.commit2\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\fI\-\-pretty\fR
format other than oneline (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. By default,
\fIcommit@{Nth}\fR
notation is used in the output\&. When the starting commit is specified as
\fIcommit@{now}\fR, output also uses
\fIcommit@{timestamp}\fR
notation instead\&. Under
\fI\-\-pretty=oneline\fR, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\&. This option cannot be combined with
\fI\-\-reverse\fR\&. See also
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a conflict and don\(cqt exist on all heads to merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-boundary
.RS 4
Output uninteresting commits at the boundary, which are usually not shown\&.
.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.
.sp
The following options select the commits to be shown:
.PP
<paths>
.RS 4
Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration
.RS 4
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history\&.
.sp
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree\&. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i\&.e\&. merging branches with the same content)
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history
.RS 4
Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits in the simplified history are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-merges
.RS 4
Additional option to
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR
to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits contributing to this merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
When given a range of commits to display (e\&.g\&.
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR
or
\fIcommit2 ^commit1\fR), only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the
\fIcommit1\fR
and
\fIcommit2\fR, i\&.e\&. commits that are both descendants of
\fIcommit1\fR, and ancestors of
\fIcommit2\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
A more detailed explanation follows\&.
.sp
Suppose you specified foo as the <paths>\&. We shall call commits that modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\&. (In a diff filtered for foo, they look different and equal, respectively\&.)
.sp
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\&. We assume that you are filtering for a file foo in this commit graph:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\-N\-\-\-O\-\-\-P

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The horizontal line of history A\-\-\-P is taken to be the first parent of each merge\&. The commits are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

I
is the initial commit, in which
foo
exists with contents "asdf", and a file
quux
exists with contents "quux"\&. Initial commits are compared to an empty tree, so
I
is !TREESAME\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

In
A,
foo
contains just "foo"\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

B
contains the same change as
A\&. Its merge
M
is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

C
does not change
foo, but its merge
N
changes it to "foobar", so it is not TREESAME to any parent\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

D
sets
foo
to "baz"\&. Its merge
O
combines the strings from
N
and
D
to "foobarbaz"; i\&.e\&., it is not TREESAME to any parent\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

E
changes
quux
to "xyzzy", and its merge
P
combines the strings to "quux xyzzy"\&. Despite appearing interesting,
P
is TREESAME to all parents\&.
.RE
.sp
\fIrev\-list\fR walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \fI\-\-full\-history\fR and/or parent rewriting (via \fI\-\-parents\fR or \fI\-\-children\fR) are used\&. The following settings are available\&.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see
\fI\-\-sparse\fR
below)\&. If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent\&. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them\&.) Otherwise, follow all parents\&.
.sp
This results in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-N\-\-\-O
         /     /   /
        I\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-D
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed
B
from consideration entirely\&.
C
was considered via
N, but is TREESAME\&. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
I
is !TREESAME\&.
.sp
Parent/child relations are only visible with \-\-parents, but that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history without parent rewriting
.RS 4
This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        I  A  B  N  D  O
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
P
and
M
were excluded because they are TREESAME to a parent\&.
E,
C
and
B
were all walked, but only
B
was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear\&.
.sp
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history with parent rewriting
.RS 4
Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed, see
\fI\-\-sparse\fR
below)\&.
.sp
Merges are always included\&. However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves\&. This results in
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\-N\-\-\-O\-\-\-P
         /     /   /   /   /

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Compare to
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR
without rewriting above\&. Note that
E
was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to contain
E\*(Aqs parent
I\&. The same happened for
C
and
N\&. Note also that
P
was included despite being TREESAME\&.
.RE
.sp
In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits that are walked are included\&.
.sp
Note that without
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR, this still simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-merges
.RS 4
First, build a history graph in the same way that
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR
with parent rewriting does (see above)\&.
.sp
Then simplify each commit \(oqC` to its replacement
C\(cq

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

.RE
.sp
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR
with parent rewriting\&. The example turns into:
.sp

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

N\*(Aqs parent list had

removed, because it is an ancestor of the other parent

remained because it is !TREESAME\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

P\*(Aqs parent list similarly had

removed\&.
P
was then removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME\&.
.RE

.sp
Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry chain between the "from" and "to" commits in the given commit range\&. I\&.e\&. only display commits that are ancestor of the "to" commit, and descendants of the "from" commit\&.

A regular
\fID\&.\&.M\fR
computes the set of commits that are ancestors of

D"\&. The result in this example would be all the commits, except
A

B

itself, of course)\&.
.sp
When we want to find out what commits in

The \fI\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration\fR option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on the command line\&. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away)\&.
.SS "Commit Ordering"
.sp
By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order\&.
.PP
\-\-topo\-order
.RS 4
This option makes them appear in topological order (i\&.e\&. descendant commits are shown before their parents)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-date\-order
.RS 4
This option is similar to
\fI\-\-topo\-order\fR
in the sense that no parent comes before all of its children, but otherwise things are still ordered in the commit timestamp order\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-reverse
.RS 4
Output the commits in reverse order\&. Cannot be combined with
\fI\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR\&.
.RE
.SS "Object Traversal"
.sp
These options are mostly targeted for packing of git repositories\&.
.PP
\-\-objects
.RS 4
Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed commits\&.
\fI\-\-objects foo ^bar\fR
thus means "send me all object IDs which I need to download if I have the commit object
\fIbar\fR, but not
\fIfoo\fR"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-objects\-edge
.RS 4
Similar to
\fI\-\-objects\fR, but also print the IDs of excluded commits prefixed with a "\-" character\&. This is used by
\fBgit-pack-objects\fR(1)
to build "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on objects contained in these excluded commits to reduce network traffic\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unpacked
.RS 4
Only useful with
\fI\-\-objects\fR; print the object IDs that are not in packs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-walk
.RS 4
Only show the given revs, but do not traverse their ancestors\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-do\-walk
.RS 4
Overrides a previous \-\-no\-walk\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Formatting"
.PP
\-\-pretty[=<format>], \-\-format=<format>
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
\fI<format>\fR
can be one of
\fIoneline\fR,
\fIshort\fR,
\fImedium\fR,
\fIfull\fR,
\fIfuller\fR,
\fIemail\fR,
\fIraw\fR
and
\fIformat:<string>\fR\&. See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each format\&. When omitted, the format defaults to
\fImedium\fR\&.
.sp
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show only a partial prefix\&. Non default number of digits can be specified with "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed)\&.
.sp
This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Show the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name\&. This negates
\-\-abbrev\-commit
and those options which imply it such as "\-\-oneline"\&. It also overrides the
\fIlog\&.abbrevCommit\fR
variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-oneline
.RS 4
This is a shorthand for "\-\-pretty=oneline \-\-abbrev\-commit" used together\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding[=<encoding>]
.RS 4
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\&. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-notes[=<ref>]
.RS 4
Show the notes (see
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)) that annotate the commit, when showing the commit log message\&. This is the default for
git log,
git show
and
git whatchanged
commands when there is no
\-\-pretty,
\-\-format
nor
\-\-oneline
option given on the command line\&.
.sp
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
\fIcore\&.notesRef\fR
and
\fInotes\&.displayRef\fR
variables (or corresponding environment overrides)\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for more details\&.
.sp
With an optional
\fI<ref>\fR
argument, show this notes ref instead of the default notes ref(s)\&. The ref is taken to be in
refs/notes/
if it is not qualified\&.
.sp
Multiple \-\-notes options can be combined to control which notes are being displayed\&. Examples: "\-\-notes=foo" will show only notes from "refs/notes/foo"; "\-\-notes=foo \-\-notes" will show both notes from "refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-notes
.RS 4
Do not show notes\&. This negates the above
\-\-notes
option, by resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown\&. Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e\&.g\&. "\-\-notes \-\-notes=foo \-\-no\-notes \-\-notes=bar" will only show notes from "refs/notes/bar"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-notes[=<ref>], \-\-[no\-]standard\-notes
.RS 4
These options are deprecated\&. Use the above \-\-notes/\-\-no\-notes options instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-relative\-date
.RS 4
Synonym for
\-\-date=relative\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-date=(relative|local|default|iso|rfc|short|raw)
.RS 4
Only takes effect for dates shown in human\-readable format, such as when using "\-\-pretty"\&.
log\&.date
config variable sets a default value for log command\(cqs \-\-date option\&.
.sp
\-\-date=relative
shows dates relative to the current time, e\&.g\&. "2 hours ago"\&.
.sp
\-\-date=local
shows timestamps in user\(cqs local timezone\&.
.sp
\-\-date=iso
(or
\-\-date=iso8601) shows timestamps in ISO 8601 format\&.
.sp
\-\-date=rfc
(or
\-\-date=rfc2822) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format, often found in E\-mail messages\&.
.sp
\-\-date=short
shows only date but not time, in
YYYY\-MM\-DD
format\&.
.sp
\-\-date=raw
shows the date in the internal raw git format
%s %z
format\&.
.sp
\-\-date=default
shows timestamps in the original timezone (either committer\(cqs or author\(cqs)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-parents
.RS 4
Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit parent\&...")\&. Also enables parent rewriting, see
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-children
.RS 4
Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit child\&...")\&. Also enables parent rewriting, see
\fIHistory Simplification\fR

.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-right
.RS 4
Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from\&. Commits from the left side are prefixed with
<
and those from the right with
>\&. If combined with
\-\-boundary, those commits are prefixed with
\-\&.
.sp
For example, if you have this topology:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
             y\-\-\-b\-\-\-b  branch B
            / \e /

         o\-\-\-x\-\-\-a\-\-\-a  branch A
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
you would get an output like this:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
        $ git rev\-list \-\-left\-right \-\-boundary \-\-pretty=oneline A\&.\&.\&.B

.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
.RE
.PP
\-\-graph
.RS 4
Draw a text\-based graphical representation of the commit history on the left hand side of the output\&. This may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly\&.
.sp
This enables parent rewriting, see
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below\&.
.sp
This implies the
\fI\-\-topo\-order\fR
option by default, but the
\fI\-\-date\-order\fR
option may also be specified\&.
.RE
.SS "Diff Formatting"
.sp
Below are listed options that control the formatting of diff output\&. Some of them are specific to \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1), however other diff options may be given\&. See \fBgit-diff-files\fR(1) for more options\&.
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a time\&. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cc
.RS 4
This flag implies the
\fI\-c\fR
options and further compresses the patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge result picks one of them without modification\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry and diff is generated\&. An exception is that only diff against the first parent is shown when
\fI\-\-first\-parent\fR
option is given; in that case, the output represents the changes the merge brought
\fIinto\fR
the then\-current branch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Show recursive diffs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Show the tree objects in the diff output\&. This implies
\fI\-r\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Suppress diff output\&.
.RE
.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
.sp
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\&. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\&. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\&.
.sp
There are several built\-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty\&.<name> config option to either another format name, or a \fIformat:\fR string, as described below (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. Here are the details of the built\-in formats:

\fItformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fItformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e

\-B[<n>][/<m>], \-\-break\-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
m
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\-B/70%
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
n
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\-B20%
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.

If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see

n
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,

The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines\&. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign\&. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the new one\&.

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \- removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 nor file2)\&. Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with +)\&.
.sp
When shown by git diff\-tree \-c, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by git diff\-files \-c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\&.

\fIgit commit\fR

Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
