.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high\-level operations and full access to internals\&.
.sp
See \fBgittutorial\fR(7) to get started, then see \m[blue]\fBEveryday Git\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2 for a useful minimum set of commands, and "man git\-commandname" for documentation of each command\&. CVS users may also want to read \fBgitcvs-migration\fR(7)\&. See the \m[blue]\fBGit User\(cqs Manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2 for a more in\-depth introduction\&.
.sp
The \fI<command>\fR is either a name of a Git command (see below) or an alias as defined in the configuration file (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.sp
Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest git documentation can be viewed at http://www\&.kernel\&.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the git suite version that the
\fIgit\fR
program came from\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-help
.RS 4
Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands\&. If the option
\fI\-\-all\fR
or
\fI\-a\fR
is given then all available commands are printed\&. If a git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command\&.
.sp
Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed\&. See
\fBgit-help\fR(1)
for more information, because
git \-\-help \&...
is converted internally into
git help \&...\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c <name>=<value>
.RS 4
Pass a configuration parameter to the command\&. The value given will override values from configuration files\&. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by
\fIgit config\fR
(subkeys separated by dots)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exec\-path[=<path>]
.RS 4
Path to wherever your core git programs are installed\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable\&. If no path is given,
\fIgit\fR
will print the current setting and then exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-html\-path
.RS 4
Print the path, without trailing slash, where git\(cqs HTML documentation is installed and exit\&.

.RE
.PP
\-\-work\-tree=<path>
.RS 4
Set the path to the working tree\&. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the core\&.worktree configuration variable (see core\&.worktree in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for a more detailed discussion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-namespace=<path>

.SH "FURTHER DOCUMENTATION"
.sp
See the references above to get started using git\&. The following is probably more detail than necessary for a first\-time user\&.
.sp
The \m[blue]\fBgit concepts chapter of the user\-manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2 and \fBgitcore-tutorial\fR(7) both provide introductions to the underlying git architecture\&.
.sp
See \fBgitworkflows\fR(7) for an overview of recommended workflows\&.
.sp
See also the \m[blue]\fBhowto\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2 documents for some useful examples\&.
.sp
The internals are documented in the \m[blue]\fBGIT API documentation\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "GIT COMMANDS"
.sp
We divide git into high level ("porcelain") commands and low level ("plumbing") commands\&.

.SH "LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)"
.sp
Although git includes its own porcelain layer, its low\-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains\&. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about \fBgit-update-index\fR(1) and \fBgit-read-tree\fR(1)\&.
.sp
The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low\-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use\&. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience\&.

Various git commands use the following environment variables:
.SS "The git Repository"
.sp
These environment variables apply to \fIall\fR core git commands\&. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above git so take care if using Cogito etc\&.
.PP
\fIGIT_INDEX_FILE\fR
.RS 4
This environment allows the specification of an alternate index file\&. If not specified, the default of
$GIT_DIR/index
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY\fR
.RS 4
If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath \- otherwise the default
$GIT_DIR/objects
directory is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES\fR
.RS 4
Due to the immutable nature of git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read\-only directories\&. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of git object directories which can be used to search for git objects\&. New objects will not be written to these directories\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_DIR\fR
.RS 4
If the
\fIGIT_DIR\fR
environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default
\&.git
for the base of the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_WORK_TREE\fR
.RS 4
Set the path to the working tree\&. The value will not be used in combination with repositories found automatically in a \&.git directory (i\&.e\&. $GIT_DIR is not set)\&. This can also be controlled by the
\fI\-\-work\-tree\fR
command line option and the core\&.worktree configuration variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_NAMESPACE\fR
.RS 4
Set the git namespace; see
\fBgitnamespaces\fR(7)
for details\&. The
\fI\-\-namespace\fR
command\-line option also sets this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES\fR
.RS 4
This should be a colon\-separated list of absolute paths\&. If set, it is a list of directories that git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory\&. It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment\&. (Useful for excluding slow\-loading network directories\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM\fR
.RS 4
When run in a directory that does not have "\&.git" repository directory, git tries to find such a directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does not cross filesystem boundaries\&. This environment variable can be set to true to tell git not to stop at filesystem boundaries\&. Like
\fIGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES\fR, this will not affect an explicit repository directory set via
\fIGIT_DIR\fR
or on the command line\&.

\fIGIT_DIFF_OPTS\fR
.RS 4
Only valid setting is "\-\-unified=??" or "\-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created\&. This takes precedence over any "\-U" or "\-\-unified" option value passed on the git diff command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR
.RS 4
When the environment variable
\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR
is set, the program named by it is called, instead of the diff invocation described above\&. For a path that is added, removed, or modified,
\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR
is called with 7 parameters:

.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
path old\-file old\-hex old\-mode new\-file new\-hex new\-mode
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.RE
.PP
<old|new>\-file
.RS 4
are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,
.RE
.PP
<old|new>\-hex
.RS 4
are the 40\-hexdigit SHA1 hashes,
.RE
.PP
<old|new>\-mode
.RS 4
are the octal representation of the file modes\&.
.sp
The file parameters can point at the user\(cqs working file (e\&.g\&.
new\-file
in "git\-diff\-files"),
/dev/null
(e\&.g\&.
old\-file
when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e\&.g\&.
old\-file
in the index)\&.
\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR
should not worry about unlinking the temporary file \-\-\- it is removed when
\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR

\fIGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF\fR
is called with 1 parameter, <path>\&.

\fIGIT_PAGER\fR
.RS 4
This environment variable overrides

.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_SSH\fR
.RS 4
If this environment variable is set then
\fIgit fetch\fR
and
\fIgit push\fR
will use this command instead of
\fIssh\fR
when they need to connect to a remote system\&. The
\fI$GIT_SSH\fR
command will be given exactly two arguments: the
\fIusername@host\fR
(or just
\fIhost\fR) from the URL and the shell command to execute on that remote system\&.
.sp
To pass options to the program that you want to list in GIT_SSH you will need to wrap the program and options into a shell script, then set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell script\&.
.sp
Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal
\&.ssh/config
file\&. Please consult your ssh documentation for further details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_ASKPASS\fR
.RS 4
If this environment variable is set, then git commands which need to acquire passwords or passphrases (e\&.g\&. for HTTP or IMAP authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as command line argument and read the password from its STDOUT\&. See also the
\fIcore\&.askpass\fR
option in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE

\fIGIT_FLUSH\fR

\fIgit blame\fR
(in incremental mode),
\fIgit rev\-list\fR,
\fIgit log\fR, and
\fIgit whatchanged\fR
will force a flush of the output stream after each commit\-oriented record have been flushed\&. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O\&. If this environment variable is not set, git will choose buffered or record\-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_TRACE\fR
.RS 4
If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), git will print
trace:
messages on stderr telling about alias expansion, built\-in command execution and external command execution\&. If this variable is set to an integer value greater than 1 and lower than 10 (strictly) then git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor\&. Alternatively, if this variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a
\fI/\fR
character), git will interpret this as a file path and will try to write the trace messages into it\&.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
More detail on the following is available from the \m[blue]\fBgit concepts chapter of the user\-manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2 and \fBgitcore-tutorial\fR(7)\&.
.sp
A git project normally consists of a working directory with a "\&.git" subdirectory at the top level\&. The \&.git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads\&.
.sp
The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree and some number of parent commits\&.
.sp
The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the project\(cqs history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step\&. Commits with more than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development\&.
.sp
All objects are named by the SHA1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits\&. Such names are globally unique\&. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just that commit\&. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose\&.
.sp
When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files"\&.
.sp
Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history\&. A ref may contain the SHA1 name of an object or the name of another ref\&. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA1 name of the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development\&. SHA1 names of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/\&. A special ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently checked\-out branch\&.
.sp
The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes\&. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch\&. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc\&.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree\&. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes\&. The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index\&.
.sp
The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname\&. These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress\&.
.SH "AUTHORS"
.sp
Git was started by Linus Torvalds, and is currently maintained by Junio C Hamano\&. Numerous contributions have come from the git mailing list <\m[blue]\fBgit@vger\&.kernel\&.org\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2>\&. For a more complete list of contributors, see \m[blue]\fBhttp://git\-scm\&.com/about\fR\m[]\&. If you have a clone of git\&.git itself, the output of \fBgit-shortlog\fR(1) and \fBgit-blame\fR(1) can show you the authors for specific parts of the project\&.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
